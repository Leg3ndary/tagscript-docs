# Tagscript Docs

Welcome to the home of the updated tagscript docs, because the old one hasn't been updated in a while this is my interpretation of what good docs should be.

This is just another fun project in which I learnt how the popular amazing site [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org) hosts your documentation.
