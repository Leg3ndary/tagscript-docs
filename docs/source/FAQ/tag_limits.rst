Limits
======

There are many limits in tagscript, and some more when you use Carl.

Loops
-----

You will not have access to loops in any way, there are a few exceptions, but in general if you want to loop through values and edit them, that won't be possible.

Examples of blocks that you can use that can sort of loop:

.. code:: ansi
    [1;31m{[0;0mreplace[1;31m}[0;0m

Tag Recursion
