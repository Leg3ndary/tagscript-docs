A Basic Guide to Contributing
-----------------------------

These docs use ReStructuredText or RST, it's a fairly simple language that you can learn here `RST Docs <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_.

You could also take a look at the readthedocs sphinx theme `here <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for more info.

Finally tagscript parsing is here, though there's not much to know `here <https://github.com/Leg3ndary/tagscript-ansi>`_.

.. note::

    If you want to easily create tagscript you can do so by doing the following

    .. code:: rst

        .. tagscript::

            {=(Tagscript):Can go here}

.. raw:: html
